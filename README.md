## Usage

#### Including this in your ci.yml
```
image: anthonymonori/android-fastlane-emulator-image:latest
```

_Note: Currently supporting Travis CI and GitLab CI._

#### Creating a docker container
```
docker login
docker pull anthonymonori/android-fastlane-emulator-image:latest
docker run -it -d -p <port>:<port-internal> --name <container-name> anthonymonori/android-fastlane-emulator-image:latest
```

_Note: of course, you need to change \<port>,\<port-internal>,\<container-name> to run the above command lines. You also might want to enable the <port> variable on whatever cloud solutions you are running._

#### Gradle
Because the Fastlane [gradle action](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/lib/fastlane/actions/gradle.rb) is used, bundling Gradle into this Docker image would always take priority over the `gradlew` coming with your project. This de-coupling is helpful so we don't need to update and depend on this image, but rather let the incoming project to have its gradle wrapper execute the tasks. **It is necessary to use gradle 2.2.0 and above in order to auto-download missing SDK packages and tools during build-time**. You can specify this in your top-level build.gradle file, under dependencies:
```
dependencies {
  classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2+'
}
```

- /opt/scripts/android-wait-for-emulator.sh
- adb shell input keyevent 82
```
